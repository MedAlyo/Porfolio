# Introduction
Today's subject was an introduction to **Web Servers**.

# What I understood
I understood a lot about **Web Servers**, what is it and what are internet protocols (HTTP,HTTPS), and what is the difference between static and dynamic pages.

# What I didn't understand
I understood most of what was giving to us in class in relation to using Docker in linux and creating a container from scratch and using docker commands. 

# What did I like the most and what did I like the least?
I enjoyed having to do research about certain topics.

# What else would I like to know related to the Unit?
I think there isn't a lot to be added in this material.
