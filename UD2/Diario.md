# Introduction
Today's subject was a presentation about **WEB ARCHITECTURE** 

# What I understood
I understood a lot about web architecture, SSH and how to install apache in windows

# What I didn't understand
I understood most of what was presented by the other students

# What did I like the most and what did I like the least?
I enjoyed the presentations of some of the students that spoke in a clear voice and in an orginized way
Some of the presentation seemed rushed

# What else would I like to know related to the Unit?
I want to understand in depth how does the Microservices work as they are very confusing and make no sense
