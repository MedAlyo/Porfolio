# Introduction
Today's subject was an introduction to **Apache**, how it works and how to use it with a test webpage.

# What I understood
I understood a lot about **Apache** and to configure it in **Linux**, and how to use commands like nano.

# What I didn't understand
I understood most of what was giving to us in class in relation to using apache in linux and creating a mockup webpage and connecting to it. 

# What did I like the most and what did I like the least?
I found working in linux to be engaging and fun, and solving the small issues that arrose.
Nothing comes to mind.

# What else would I like to know related to the Unit?
I want to understand in depth how apache can be used to setup servers for real world websites and how to scall them if the need ever arrises.
