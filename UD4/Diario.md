# Introduction
Today's subject was a presentation about **SSH**. How to create a SSH server and connect a user to it.

# What I understood
I understood a lot about how SSH works, how to create a server, how to connect a user to it and how to send commands to the server.

# What I didn't understand
I understood most of what was giving to us in class in relation to using SSH in linux and creating a server and connecting to it using a user and also creating a webpage inside of the server.

# What did I like the most and what did I like the least?
I found working with SSH in Linux quite exiting, and also to connect to other servers was quite straight forward.  
Some of my colleagues used the access to shutdown our SSH servers while we were working. 

# What else would I like to know related to the Unit?
I want to understand in depth how this SSH server stuff fit in the larger web development space.
